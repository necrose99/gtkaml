**Gtkaml** is a markup language based on [Vala](http://live.gnome.org/Vala) which lets you create Gtk+ composite widgets through concise XML:

![http://gtkaml.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/hello.png](http://gtkaml.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/hello.png)
```
<HBox homogeneous="false">  
      <Label label="_Hello" with-mnemonic="true" expand="false" fill="false"/>  
      <Entry g:public="my_entry" text="World! "/>
</HBox>
```

or by using Gtkon object notation:

```
HBox !homogeneous {
  Label with-mnemonic label="_Hello" !expand !fill;
  Entry $my_entry text="World!";
}
```

### Features ###
  * compact XML syntax for describing Gtk widgets
  * JSON-like and less verbose Gtkon syntax
  * code 'islands' (written in Vala) for signal handling and other methods/signals/properties/ in your widget class (so you don't modify the generated code ever)
  * you don't depend on gtkaml at run-time
  * much more readable than the usual UI boilerplate (e.g. you don't need to worry about temporary variable names, or ever write hundreds of lines of code)
  * works with any library that has a .vapi file, not just Gtk+ (composition methods can be specified in the .implicits file)


To see a sample of what `gtkaml` looks like, see the examples [here](Example.md).
Have a look at the [design goals](DesignGoals.md) for a quick specification + advancements in development. A [reference](Reference.md) of the gtkaml keywords is made available too. Examples can be found in /tests and /examples in the source distribution.

You can discuss about `gtkaml` on the [gtkaml-dev](http://groups.google.com/group/gtkaml-dev) mailing list or you can <a href='http://www.twitter.com/gtkaml'><img width='110' alt='Follow gtkaml on Twitter' src='http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/follow_us-a.png' /></a>.

### Using Gtkaml? ###
Then [let us know](GtkamlUsers.md)!

### (2013-01-03) gtkaml 0.6 beta 3 ###
This third beta release contains the following fixes compared to beta2:
  * prevent a crasher when class name is blank
  * stop stripping CDATA tags' leading and trailing whitespaces
  * honor -D defines in the context used to parse members
  * honoring -d for .gtkaml generated files
  * fix a bug copying fields twice if generated automatically by properties

Support was added for enum literals, like `<Window type='toplevel' />`

There should be **no** notable differences compared to 0.4.3's functionality other than:
  * compatibility with Vala 0.18
  * source files' order from command line is not relevant anymore (previous architectural limitation)
  * support for custom creation methods (the `construct` will still be generated by gtkaml)
  * support for enum literals
  * '.implicits' files renamed to '.markuphints'

Source is available in the svn branch gtkaml-0.6 for now.


### (2011-03-22) gtkaml 0.4.3 ###
  * #! shebang support for GtkON files to be used with the `gtkaml` executable
  * vim syntax files for gtkon and gtkaml files. (thanks pancake@nopcode.org). See editors/vim/README on how to use them.
  * removed own debian/`*` files in favour of debian's own packaging scripts (thanks David <dapal@debian.org>)
  * optional running of tests with --enable-tests at configure stage

See the [release notes](ReleaseNotes.md).
